Worktips pool
====================
Formerly known as cryptonote-forknote-pool, forked from TurtleCoin and adjusted for Worktips coin.

High performance Node.js (with native C addons) mining pool for Cryptonote based coin.

Comes with lightweight example front-end script which uses the pool's AJAX API.

#### Basic features

* TCP (stratum-like) protocol for server-push based jobs
  * Compared to old HTTP protocol, this has a higher hash rate, lower network/CPU server load, lower orphan
    block percent, and less error prone
* IP banning to prevent low-diff share attacks
* Socket flooding detection
* Payment processing
  * Splintered transactions to deal with max transaction size
  * Minimum payment threshold before balance will be paid out
  * Minimum denomination for truncating payment amount precision to reduce size/complexity of block transactions
* Detailed logging
* Ability to configure multiple ports - each with their own difficulty
* Variable difficulty / share limiter
* Share trust algorithm to reduce share validation hashing CPU load
* Clustering for vertical scaling
* Modular components for horizontal scaling (pool server, database, stats/API, payment processing, front-end)
* Live stats API (using AJAX long polling with CORS)
  * Currency network/block difficulty
  * Current block height
  * Network hashrate
  * Pool hashrate
  * Each miners' individual stats (hashrate, shares submitted, pending balance, total paid, etc)
  * Blocks found (pending, confirmed, and orphaned)
* An easily extendable, responsive, light-weight front-end using API to display data

#### Extra features

* Admin panel
  * Aggregated pool statistics
  * Coin daemon & wallet RPC services stability monitoring
  * Log files data access
  * Users list with detailed statistics
* Historic charts of pool's hashrate and miners count, coin difficulty, rates and coin profitability
* Historic charts of users's hashrate and payments
* Miner login(wallet address) validation
* Five configurable CSS themes
* Universal blocks and transactions explorer based on [chainradar.com](http://chainradar.com)
* FantomCoin & MonetaVerde support
* Set fixed difficulty on miner client by passing "address" param with ".[difficulty]" postfix
* Prevent "transaction is too big" error with "payments.maxTransactionAmount" option

Usage
===

#### Requirements

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) v0.10+ ([follow these installation instructions](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager))
* [Redis](http://redis.io/) key-value store v2.6+ ([follow these instructions](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart))
* libssl required for the node-multi-hashing module
* For Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev`


#### 1) POOL SETUP

Rebuild the coin from the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/worktips/worktips using the instructions in the repository Readme.md file.

-  Start the daemon in the RPC mode

```
./worktipsd --rpc-bind-port=18238
```

-  Generate the pool wallet using walletd

```
./walletd --container-file=YOURWALLETNAME --container-password=YOURWALLETPASSWORD --daemon-port=18238 --bind-port=8082 --rpc-legacy-security --generate-container
```

-  Start the wallet using walletd

```
./walletd --container-file=YOURWALLETNAME --container-password=YOURWALLETPASSWORD --daemon-port=18238 --bind-port=8082 --rpc-legacy-security
```

Note: if you want to use the RPC password please set it in the pool wallet config section in the file config.js


-  Setup pool environment

```
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```

```
sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy
```

```
sudo apt-get install npm
```

```
npm config set strict-ssl false
```

```
sudo apt-get install tk8.5 tcl8.5
```

```
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev 
```

-  Install Redis database

```
wget http://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz
```

```
tar xvzf redis-stable.tar.gz
```

```
cd redis-stable
```

```
make
```

```
make test
```

```
sudo apt-get install redis-server
```

- Start Redis server

```
redis-server
```

-  Clone the pool repository

```
git clone https://github.com/worktips/worktips-pool.git pool
```

-  Run the pool NPM update

```
cd pool
```

```
npm update
```

-  Start the pool (ONLY AFTER YOU HAVE CONFIGURED IT - see below for configuration)

```
sudo node init.js
```

```

#### 3) Troubleshooting


- NPM issues resolving

```
sudo apt-get remove npm
```

```
sudo apt-get remove nodejs-legacy
```

```
sudo apt-get remove nodejs
```

```
sudo rm /usr/bin/node
```

```
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```

```
sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy
```

```
sudo apt-get install npm
```

- NODEJS alternative installations

```
wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.25/node-v0.10.25.tar.gz && tar xvzf node-v0.10.25.tar.gz
```

```
cd node-v0.10.25
```

```
make
```

```
sudo make install
```

OR:

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_0.10 | sudo -E bash -
```

```
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

THEN RUN:

```
cd pool
```

```
npm update
```

IF IT STILL FAILS:

```
cd pool
```

```
sudo rm -rf node_modules
```

```
sudo rm -rf ~/.node-gyp
```

```
npm update
```


#### 4) Host the front-end

Simply host the contents of the `website_example` directory on file server capable of serving simple static files.


Edit the variables in the `website_example/config.js` file to use your pool's specific configuration.
Variable explanations:

```javascript

/* Must point to the API setup in your config.json file. */
var api = "http://poolhost:8117";

/* Pool server host to instruct your miners to point to.  */
var poolHost = "poolhost.com";

/* IRC Server and room used for embedded KiwiIRC chat. */
var irc = "irc.freenode.net/#forknote";

/* Contact email address. */
var email = "support@poolhost.com";

/* Market stat display params from https://www.cryptonator.com/widget */
var cryptonatorWidget = ["DSH-BTC", "DSH-USD", "DSH-EUR"];

/* Download link to cryptonote-easy-miner for Windows users. */
var easyminerDownload = "https://github.com/zone117x/cryptonote-easy-miner/releases/";

/* Used for front-end block links. */
var blockchainExplorer = "http://chainradar.com/{symbol}/block/{id}";

/* Used by front-end transaction links. */
var transactionExplorer = "http://chainradar.com/{symbol}/transaction/{id}";

/* Any custom CSS theme for pool frontend */
var themeCss = "themes/default-theme.css";

```

#### 5) Customize your website

The following files are included so that you can customize your pool website without having to make significant changes
to `index.html` or other front-end files thus reducing the difficulty of merging updates with your own changes:
* `custom.css` for creating your own pool style
* `custom.js` for changing the functionality of your pool website


Then simply serve the files via nginx, Apache, Google Drive, or anything that can host static content.


#### 6) Using walletd instead of simplewallet for payments

This pool uses walletd for RPC queries with added RPC security. More information on how to upgrade from simplewallet to walletd please see the following post: [Use walletd instead of simplewallet for payments](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtle-pool/pull/5)
